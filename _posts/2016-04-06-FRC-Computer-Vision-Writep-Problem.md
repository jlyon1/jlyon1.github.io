title: Team 3044 Stronghold Vision Part 1: The Problem 
---

This year's FRC Game FIRST Stronghold presented a strong advantage to teams who could successfully track Retro Reflective tape targets that surrounded the high goals on the field. In this first post, I will begin to discuss the challenge presented by the game this year, as they were viewed during Team 3044's initial setup and analysis, as well as begin to address some unforseen issues later on. This article assumes you are already familiar with the game as presented [here](http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/competition-manual-qa-system) Although it is not necessary that you know the game to understand this.
