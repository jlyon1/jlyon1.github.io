title: Why is Computer Vision Important in FRIST Robotics?/FRC Vision Constants
---

Computer vision has been an element of FRC games for many years, however, it always ends up not being utilized on our team, and many FIRST teams. This is usually due to a variety of factors, however, It should be noted, that computer vision often provides a huge advantage to teams who decide to use it. In shooting games, it allows team's to guide their shots, depending on robot design, allowing them to shoot without pausing in motion. Many teams use these vision solutions in order to guide their robots to making most of the shots they take, often times over 90% accuracy. In non shooting games, computer vision often allows teams to track non moving elements of the game, notably the yellow totes and green containers in Recycle Rush (2014-2015).

The advantages of computer vision seem fairly obvious, and often times the implementation of code to gain these advantages can be simple, however, many teams do not take advantage of the possibility of using a Vision system. FIRST clearly intends to encourage vision systems, by providing cameras, LED rings, and retro reflective tape, however, the spread notion that vision code is slow, hard to write, and often challenging for teams prevent many from even attempting to gain the benefits of computer vision.

Vision code, however, does not need to be difficult... (WIP)
