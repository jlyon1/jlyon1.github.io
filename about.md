Engineering and technology have been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember.  Beginning with a demonstration from my High school's FIRST Robotics Competition [FRC](http://www.firstinspires.org) team in fifth grade. I continued with this passion throughout middle school, Joining the Lego robotics team, and continuing throughout high school. Starting as a programmer, and rising through the ranks of the team, I am currently Team captain, and have had over eight years of programming experience.

I have taken on many ventures outside robotics, programming and otherwise, especially having a fascination for Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence, and Computer vision. This website is to serve as an outlet for these ventures.
